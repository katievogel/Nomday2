# Nomday2
This app is a work in progress. It is a Yelp-like app inspired by the difficulty my coworkers have when deciding where to go for lunch every Monday - not wanting to repeat the same things too often, trying to find new things, and making notes on whether they liked it or didn't like it and the last date they went there.
